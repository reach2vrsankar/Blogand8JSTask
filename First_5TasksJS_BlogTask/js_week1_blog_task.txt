1. difference between HTTP1. 1 vs HTTP2:

->Page load speed improvements trough:
->Compression of request headers
->Binary protocol
->HTTP/2 Server Push
->Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection
->Request pipelining
->HOL blocking (Head-of-line) — Package blocking

2. http version history:
->HTTP/0.9 – The one-line protocol
	GET /mypage.html
->HTTP/1.0 – Building extensibility
	HTTP headers
->HTTP/1.1 – The standardized protocol
->More than 15 years of extensions
	->Using HTTP for secure transmissions
	->Using HTTP for complex applications
	->Relaxing the security-model of the Web
	->
->HTTP/2 – A protocol for greater performance
->HTTP/3 - HTTP over QUIC

3. List 5 difference between Browser js console vs Node js

	->Javascript is capable enough to add HTML and play with the DOM.
	->Javascript can run in any browser engine as like JS core in safari and Spidermonkey in Firefox.
	->Javascript is used in frontend development.

->Node js :
	->NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment.
	->NodeJS code can be run outside the browser.
	->It is mostly used on the server-side.

4. what happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser
    1) You enter a URL into a web browser
    2) The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS
    3) The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
    4) The server sends back a HTTP response
    5) The browser begins rendering the HTML
    6) The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5.
    7) Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.
