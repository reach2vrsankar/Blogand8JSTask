2. Give a write-up on the Difference between copy by value and copy by reference.
->JavaScript has 5 data types that are copied by value: Boolean, null, undefined, String, and Number. We’ll call these primitive types.

->JavaScript has 3 data types that are copied by having their reference copied: Array, Function, and Object. These are all technically Objects, so we’ll refer to them collectively as Objects.
	Now let's take an example of copy by reference. In fact let's take your example of copy by reference:

		var objA = {a: 1};
		var objB = objA;
		objA.a = 2;
		objB.a; // 2
3. How to copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects).
	->Using the spread ( ... ) operator.
	->Using the Object.assign() method.
	->Using the JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods.
